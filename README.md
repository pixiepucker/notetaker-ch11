  ## Description and Preview âœ¨
  For this week's challenge, we were to build the backend of a project called Note Taker. I accomplished this by utilizing Module 11 lessons and class activities from the previous week. I also flexed my collaboration muscles and teamed up with classmates to troubleshoot and polish up my code. This project came with the frontend logic built so all I had to do was write the connections for the server using JS, express, and fs.
